Welcome to this escape room game!

The plot
----------
This is 3100, and many more technologies had been created,
including strange things like game locks (locks that open if
you win in a game), x-ray glasses that can see through things
etc.

You live in this era, and being as unlucky as you would be, you
are kidnapped and locked in a suspicious room.
Of course, you have to escape FAST, or risk death by the strong
lasers that would kill you in an hour's time...

Instructions
--------------
During the game, type `help` to show this help message, `help
[object's name]` to show the object's individual help message and
commands, `show inventory` to check your inventory`, `enter 
[place's name]` to enter a place in the game, and `quit` to quit 
the game.

Whenever you enter a place, the game will always provide you with 
these information:
"""
This is a [name of place].
You saw [list of interactable items].
"""
You may ask for help on how to further interact with these items
by typing `help` + a space + [name of item in list]. Note that 
other objects may also be interactable but not shown in the list
of available items, but their names can definitely be found somewhere
in the game (eg. by examining an object).

Once you are ready and read through the instructions, press enter to start the game:
